Topic: Sockets

Description: 
Developing further on the sockets lab that we learned in this class, using python and framework such as flask and sockets library. This project consists of a server file named main.py. First run the server file and it will output a link that the user can open in any web browser. There the user is asked to enter a user name and message. In order to test the program, open another window and go to the same link as before and see if the chat application works. The user can add as many people on the application as long as other users also have the same server file.

Challenges:
The lab taught us how sockets work within the terminals. In order to have this kind of program work on a website, Flask was needed to be implemented. At first the server file produced some errors while compiling due to some wrong use of JSON.
Other than some simple syntax errors, and the installation of flask framework, it turned out to be pretty easy to implement.

I have further improvements in mind for this application, such as asking the users for a passwork to make it more secure. Improving on the WebUI to make it look more appealing.

Reproduce this project:
Pre-requisites:
-install python environment
-install flask framework and required socket libraries.

clone/download the zip folder.
confirm that you have 
folder: templates 
server file: main.py

run the python file: main.py
go to the link that is displayed when the server file runs successfully.
open the link in two different browsers/windows
enter any username and message and see if it works in all the opened browsers/windows.
